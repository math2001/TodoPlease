# TodoPlease

This is a small package to list all your todo's in your project.

## How it works

It's simple: it looks for a todo in all your Sublime Text project (the one that you can see when
you go to *Project â†’ Quick Switch Project*)

## [ProjectManager][] is supported

If you use [ProjectManager][] (I recommend you do :wink:), then it'll use the project from this
package instead of the regular ones.
